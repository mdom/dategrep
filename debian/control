Description: print lines matching a date range
 dategrep searches the named input files for lines matching a date range
 and prints them to stdout.
 .
 If dategrep works on a seekable file, it can do a binary search to find
 the first and last line to print pretty efficiently. dategrep can also
 read from stdin and compressed files, but it has to parse every single
 line until the end of the range for those.
